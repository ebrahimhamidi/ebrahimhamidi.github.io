abstract = {Although various numerical techniques have been applied over the last few decades to solve the mild slope equation (MSE), each technique has its own limitations, particularly in terms of computational cost, accuracy, and stability. Localised differential quadrature method (LDQM) is here investigated as an alternative new solution to the MSE. Localised DQM, rather than classical DQM, was used to solve the MSE because of its improved performance, lower computational cost and wider range of applicability. To evaluate the proposed method, four examples were studied, covering a range of complexity which included propagation and transformation of waves due to an elliptic shoal, breakwater gap, and non-rectangular harbour resonance. The results were compared with experimental data, analytical solutions, and other numerical methods. The agreement between numerical and benchmark results was good, and in some cases the performance of LDQM exceeded that of other numerical methods. LDQM can lead to accurate results using fewer grid points and lower computational cost if the number of local nodes is optimised. For a large number of local grid points in LDQM, and also for the case of classical DQM, iterative methods such as conjugate gradient should be employed to solve the system of equations.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
