Introduction to Mixture of Experts (MoE) Models in Deep Learning
Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a neural network architecture designed to dynamically allocate computational resources by using multiple expert subnetworks, each specializing in different aspects of a problem. The core idea behind MoE is to improve efficiency and scalability by selectively activating only a subset of the available experts for each input, rather than using a single large model for all computations.
