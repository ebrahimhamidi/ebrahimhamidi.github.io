You will need a local installation of <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>. Read on for a more detailed guide of how to set this up.</p> <p><a name="purpose"></a></p> <h3 id="purpose-of-this-post">Purpose of this post</h3> <hr/> <p><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> is a great online tool for editing and compiling LaTeX documents. It has useful <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Can_multiple_authors_edit_the_same_file_at_the_same_time%3F">collaboration features</a> and a surprisingly robust <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans">free tier membership</a>. However, Overleaf needs an internet connection to compile your documents. Additionally, several useful features are not available in the free tier membership:</p> <ul> <li>git integration</li> <li>cloud drive sync</li> <li>longer compile time allocations</li> </ul> <p>When I had my first interview for my Ph.D. at the University of Alabama (UA), my current advisor, Dr. Hamed Moftakhari, mentioned the National Water Center (NWC) summer institute and highlighted the numerous opportunities that could come my way if I chose UA for my graduate studies. He was right. Involvement with the Civil Engineering Department, closely connected to NWC, and collaboration with the Center for Complex Hydrosystems Research at UA have provided fantastic opportunities, strengthening my research and enhancing my skills for future endeavors. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate, focusing on assessing compound coastal flood hazards through an integrated approach that combines hydrodynamic simulations, remote sensing data analysis, and statistical techniques, leveraging high-performance and cloud computing resources. .[^1]</p> <p>Recently I switched to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> as my editor of choice and have been exploring the extensions that it has available. I found the extension <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop">LaTeX-Workshop</a> to offer exactly what I was looking for: a local LaTeX environment with comparable convenience to Overleaf. If you’re interested in switching from Overleaf to VS Code, hopefully this post is helpful.Throughout my graduate studies, I have had the privilege of making several contributions to CUAHSI. My first involvement was associated with attending the 2022 NWC Summer Innovators Program as a research fellow. During the summer institute (SI), we arranged a research group with various skills, knowledge, and abilities from the graduate fellows in SI to work on projects aligned with the NWC mission. Although we experienced seven weeks of challenges and ups and downs, with the guidance of theme leads and the support of NWC scientists, we concluded the summer institute with fantastic outcomes developing a coastal-inland couple model to the Next Generation National Water Model Framework. During the SI, CUAHSI provided the fellows with a variety of scientific workshops and meetings as well as social fun events to make a strong bond between research fellows, theme leads, NWC, and CUAHSI researchers. This unique environment was well-designed for graduate students to go further than their comfort zones, and tightly collaborate with pioneer researchers in the advanced water community. <a name="insttex"></a></p> <h3 id="installing-tex-live">Installing TeX Live</h3> <hr/> <p>These instructions are adapted from LaTeX-Workshop’s <a href="https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install#installation">excellent wiki</a>.</p> <p>In order to use LaTeX-Workshop you must first have a local installation of TeX Live. The TeX Live <a href="https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html">quick install</a> worked fine on my M1 Macbook Pro. The steps I followed to install from the terminal are below. The quick install page also has directions if you are using Linux or Windows or prefer a GUI installer.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> the last command downloads over 7 GB onto your computer. Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--scheme=small</code> flag results in a smaller installation but does not have all of the features required by LaTeX-Workshop out of the box.</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp <span class="c"># or wherever you prefer</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">tar </span>xzvf install-tl-unx.tar.gz <span class="c"># uncompress the tarball</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>install-tl-<span class="k">*</span> <span class="c"># uncompressed directory's name ends with today's YYYYMMDD date</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>The installation step took about two hours for me with a relatively slow internet connection. After installing I received this warning:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>*** PLEASE READ THIS WARNING ***********************************

The following (inessential) packages failed to install properly:

You can fix this by running this command:
  tlmgr update --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed
to complete the installation.

However, if the problem was a failure to download (by far the
most common cause), check that you can connect to the chosen mirror
in a browser; you may need to specify a mirror explicitly.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Finally, I added the path to TeX Live’s executables to my PATH environment variable. The installer will print out the path to add after a successful installation. For me this was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/universal-darwin</code>. If you are unsure how to edit your PATH environment variable, a quick Google search should do the trick. I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zsh</code>, so I added the line</p> <div class="language-zsh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/universal-darwin:</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span><span class="s2">"</span>

If you update your PATH and are still having trouble, check out <a href="https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install#setting-path-environment-variable">possible solutions from the wiki</a>.</p> <p>Download one of your Overleaf projects from Overleaf’s website, unzip, and open up the main <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> file with VS Code. If you don’t have a LaTeX project to use, feel free to try out my CV which is <a href="https://github.com/markwang0/cv">on GitHub</a>. Then, you can build/compile your document by pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> on Windows). To bring up the PDF viewer, press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> on Windows).</p> <p>At this point, you can compile your documents in VS Code. In the next section I will share some optional configurations to make LaTeX-Workshop behave more like Overleaf.</p> <p><a name="conlat"></a></p> <h3 id="configuring-latex-workshop">Configuring LaTeX-Workshop</h3> <hr/> <p>LaTeX-Workshop with TeX Live worked for me right out of the box. All the packages I needed were included, including some that seem niche like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fontawesome5</code>. If there is a package that you don’t have locally, install it from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (<a href="https://www.ctan.org/search">CTAN</a>). You can use the command line tool <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tlmgr</code> included with TeX Live:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>tlmgr <span class="nb">install</span> &lt;package1&gt; &lt;package2&gt; ...
